# WindCraft Starter Kit

This repository is a collection of components to get started with a new project. It's based of the React Aria Components Tailwind Starter Kit and modified to use the Shadcn-ui Themes.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html)
* [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com)

## Why?

We want to share the work we have done in our projects, these components are part of the setup in [PlatformPlatform](https://github.com/platformplatform/PlatformPlatform) an enterprise grade platform for building web applications.

We are heavily inspired by the work of:
* [React Aria Tailwind Starter](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html)
* [Fluent UI](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-introduction--page)
* [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
* [Adobe Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html)
* [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
* [Material ui](https://mui.com/material-ui)
* [Design Tokens](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/)
* [Evilmartians color magic](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/better-dynamic-themes-in-tailwind-with-oklch-color-magic)
* [Leonardo Color](https://leonardocolor.io/theme.html#)
* [Viridis Color maps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)
* [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/)
