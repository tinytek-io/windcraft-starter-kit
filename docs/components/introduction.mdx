# Introduction

WindCraft is a collection of components based on React Aria Components and Tailwind. These components are designed to be highly accessible and customizable, making it easier for developers to build user interfaces.

The styling of WindCraft components is inspired by Shadcn/ui, but it has been adapted to align with the design principles of PlatformPlatform. This ensures a consistent and cohesive look and feel across your application.
