# Introduction

This is a collection of templates that can be used to build a user interface. Each template is a composition of components that are designed to work together to provide a specific user interface.

We have a few templates that are ready to use and are part of [PlatformPlatform](https://github.com/platformplatform/PlatformPlatform) already!

## Example

import {Card} from '@/ui/components/Card';
import {VerifyCodeForm} from '@/ui/templates/VerifyCodeForm';

<Card className='w-full'>
  <VerifyCodeForm />
</Card>
