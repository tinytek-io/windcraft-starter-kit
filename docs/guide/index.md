# Getting Started

We have included licenses for all the dependencies, please make sure to include them in your project and give due credit. Also consider supporting the projects that have made this possible 🙏

## Installation

Copy the components from `src` you need into your project, we are working on a way to make this easier.

For now we use the Shadcn-ui Themes check out the [Shadcn Guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/manual) for more information.
